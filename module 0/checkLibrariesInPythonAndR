#Two types of libraries


#### For Python

#Pre-installed...
#https://docs.python.org/3/library/

#More libraries to install..
#https://pypi.org/
#Use a search engine, check communities, discussion boards, pypi

# Step 1: Checking what you have

### How do I know a package isn't available in my enviornment?
#a). Path #1 - see what libraries you do have
help("modules")

#b). Path #2 (my prefered way)
#import and see if it fails/works!
import plotly

# Step 2: Installing

#In conda
#Search conda
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/plotly

#Run on command line (Mac terminal or Windows shell)
#Installing
conda install -c anaconda plotly

# Step 3: Loading
#for entire workspace
import plotly

#or for specific modules
from plotly import tools






#### For R

#Pre-installed...
#https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/doc/html/packages.html

#More libraries to install..
#https://www.r-pkg.org
#Use a search engine, check communities, discussion boards, r-pkg

# Step 1: Checking what you have

### How do I know a package isn't available in my enviornment?
#a). Path #1 - see what libraries you do have
sessionInfo()
installed.packages()[,c(1,3:4)]
#"recommended" come with R, "base" come with R and are pre-loaded (i.e. library("tools") is not necessary)

#b). Path #2 (my prefered way)
#import and see if it fails/works!
library("corrplot")

# Step 2: Installing

#Search for library name
https://www.r-pkg.org

#can run in RStudio, commandline (Mac terminal or Windows shell)
install.packages("corrplot")

# Step 3: Loading

#for entire workspace
library("corrplot")
