The Microsoft SQL Server can also live on a Microsoft Azure instance if the database is designed to work on the cloud.  It has a ton of other features, but notably (for data science) it has a service called SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) that provides tools for Machine Learning and Data Analysis (I won't be using these).\n",

    "### What is a NoSQL Database?\n",
    "A NoSQL database is not as strictly defined as a SQL database.  It is really any database that is not a SQL database. The key difference is that a SQL database finds data 'relationally' by performing qeueries that group shared columns together; where-as a NoSQL database generally needs a path or an id that points directly to the file in question. Data can still be stored relationally, in that a piece of data can hold an id pointing to another piece of data, but this type of query would take two seperate commands to get to that second piece of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where a SQL database enforces strict typing and defining columns ahead of time, a NoSQL database is \"schema-less\" meaning that the type of data isn't enforced when it is stored. Furthermore, there is no consistent language used in a NoSQL database, such as the SQL language or CRUD operation workflow, rather, access to data is usually governed by a RESTful API (REpresentational State Transfer), a style for building systems that ensures consistent results. \n",
    "\n",
    "A schema-less interface is convenient for a project like mine, where I might discover a new field that I need while working with the data, I don't need to modify every piece of data in the database to add the new field.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/NoSQL_documents.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Not having SQL means that we have to get creative at times with how we store and retrieve data. For example, say I want to store all my tweets as well as the users who tweeted them.  I probably want to have a seperate collection of users, and because we can no longer use SQL joins to collect users and tweets in one queury, it's better to make duplicate data in the two collections. This is because it is generally better to optimize reading data than writing it.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/NoSQL_duplicate_data.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest benefits of a NoSQL database is the way it is able to scale. When we have a lot of users on a SQL database, we need to scale vertically, meaning, putting our database on bigger machines. With a NoSQL database, the DBMS can spread the data across multiple servers behind the scenes, providing faster data access for users; this is known as scaling horizontally."

I could make a website that uses JavaScript to display graphs depicting my study that \"subscribes\" to the data, and each time it is updated, my website will recieve the updates and immediately display the results without the need for another qeuery.\n",
